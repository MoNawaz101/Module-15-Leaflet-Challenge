# Module-15-Leaflet-Challenge

## Task  
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet

## Files  
[Leaflet-Part-1/index.html](Leaflet-Part-1/index.html)  
- This is the html file which creates the web page on which the earthquake map is displayed. It was provided as part of the starter files.

[Leaflet-Part-1/static/css/style.css](Leaflet-Part-1/static/css/style.css)  
- This is the Cascading Style Sheet used for the map on the web page

[Leaflet-Part-1/static/js/logic.js](Leaflet-Part-1/static/js/logic.js)  
- This is the JavaScript file called from index.html which sets up the map layer and the earthquake markers. It does the following:
  - The earthquake markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size
  - The markers reflect the depth of the earthquake by colour
  - Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked such as magnitude, location and depth of the earthquake
  - A legend that provides context for the map data
